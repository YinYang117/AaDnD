# Dungeons & Dragons / Pathfinder Game

Welcome to the Dungeons & Dragons Game project! This is a web-based application built with React for our community to play and program a tabletop role-playing game. The goal of this project is to provide a platform where we can create characters, embark on exciting adventures, experience immersive storytelling, enhance our programming skills, and work with AI tools to become more proficient.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YinYang117/AaDnD.git` or `git@github.com:YinYang117/AaDnD.git`
3. Front end not setup yet
2. Install dependencies: cd into BackendExpress: `npm i`
3. Start the development server: from BackendExpress: `npm start`

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your browser to access the app.
